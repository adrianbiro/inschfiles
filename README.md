# inschfiles

The goal of this script is to track files that the newly installed program creates in the user's home directory. Or just to observe what files are
changed by some actions. For this reason, the scan of the file system
began from the current working directory and not from the fixed path of
the user's home one.

Output files are stored in ```~/.inschfiles``` directory.
